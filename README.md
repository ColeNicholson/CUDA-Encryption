# CUDA Encryption
 This code parallelizes a simple ecb encryption algorithm to work with CUDA-C

I was struggling to get this code to compile in my IDE so I ran all this through Command Line
and as such I included the file compileline.txt which shows what command I used to get nvcc
and Microsoft's compiler to play nicely.
